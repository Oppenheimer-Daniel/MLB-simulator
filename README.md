# ⚾ MLB Simulation Project (IN PROGRESS)

## 🚧 Status: Active Development

This project is currently under active development. Features and structure are subject to change. Please note that the code is not yet stable or complete.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this Python project is to create a realistic simulation engine for Major League Baseball (MLB) games and seasons. The simulation aims to accurately predict game outcomes and season standings based on historical and current player data.

## ✨ Planned Features

* **Core Game Engine:** Logic to simulate individual pitch-by-pitch and plate appearances.
* **Player Data Integration:** Import and use real-world player statistics (e.g., career batting average, pitching ERA) as probability drivers.
* **Season Simulation:** Ability to run full 162-game seasons for all 30 teams.
* **Data Output:** Generation of summary statistics and playoff odds.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Current Stage)

For now, the project is a local development environment. Once the core logic is stable, instructions on how to clone, set up, and run the simulation will be added here.

## 💡 Feedback

Any suggestions or ideas are welcome, but please note that the main focus at this stage is on developing the foundational simulation logic.
