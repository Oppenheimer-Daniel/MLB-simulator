## üéØ Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a realistic simulation engine for Major League Baseball (MLB) games and seasons. The simulation aims to predict game outcomes and season standings based on historical and current player data. 

## ‚ú® Planned Features
- **Core Game Engine:** Logic to simulate pitch-by-pitch and plate appearances  
- **Player Data Integration:** Import real-world player stats (BA, OBP, ERA, etc.)  
- **Season Simulation:** Full 162-game schedule for all 30 teams  
- **Data Output:** Generate summary stats and playoff odds  

## üõ†Ô∏è Current Stage
- Implemented: `Player` class with attributes, hit logic, power mapping  
- Next up: Walks, strikeouts, and OBP logic  

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
- [x] Player class with base hit logic  
- [x] Walks & strikeouts simulation  
- [ ] Team class with lineup management  
- [ ] Game engine (9 innings, scoring, base-running)  
- [ ] Season simulation (full schedule)  
- [ ] Web scraping integration (MLB.com, BR, Savant)  

## üí° Feedback
Suggestions are welcome! At this stage, the main focus is building the core simulation logic.
